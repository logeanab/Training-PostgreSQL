Successfully created and managed a relational database table using PostgreSQL. Demonstrated proficiency in executing core SQL commands including:

CREATE TABLE to define the table structure with appropriate data types and constraints
INSERT INTO to populate the table with sample data
SELECT queries to retrieve and filter data based on specific conditions
DROP TABLE to safely remove unnecessary tables
This exercise showcased a solid understanding of database fundamentals, data manipulation, and query operations within a PostgreSQL environment.

I also use commands like: NULL, NOT NULL & DEFAULT
